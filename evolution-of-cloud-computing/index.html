                    In 2010, cloud computing was evolving rapidly, transforming how businesses and individuals stored and accessed data. Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure provided scalable and flexible solutions for computing resources, enabling organizations to reduce IT costs and increase efficiency. The adoption of cloud computing facilitated the growth of big data analytics, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and remote work capabilities.
